# DATA-SCIENCE-TASK-1
 🧠 Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship
 Task 1 – Data Visualization

 📌 Objective
Visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using appropriate charts (bar, pie, histogram, etc.).  
This helps in understanding how the data is spread and identifying key patterns or trends.


📊 Dataset Used
**World Population Dataset**  
Source: [DataHub – Population Dataset](https://datahub.io/core/population)  
Contains population data (in number of people) for each country from 1960 to 2022, derived from World Bank records.

 ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

📈 Steps Performed
1. **Loaded the dataset** from an online source.  
2. **Filtered data** for the year 2020 (latest available).  
3. **Selected top 10 most populated countries.**  
4. **Created visualizations:**
   - Bar chart of top 10 populated countries.  
   - Pie chart showing their population share.  
   - Histogram of population distribution for all countries.  
5. **Derived insights** on global population patterns.

 🧩 Key Insights
- China and India together account for a significant portion of the world’s population.  
- The population distribution is highly skewed — only a few countries have very large populations.  
- Most countries have populations below 100 million.
